# CV Transition Lab

This repo tracks my 8-week plan to learn Computer Vision (CS231N Spring 2025) with hands-on projects and weekly reports.

## What’s inside
- `notes/` — short notes per lecture
- `notebooks/` — experiments and explorations
- `src/` — reusable training and evaluation code
- `reports/` — weekly results and error analysis
- `demos/` — small demos and example runs

## Setup
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
